Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: N = 10 and  N = 100 proved incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: N = 10 000 is good enough.
